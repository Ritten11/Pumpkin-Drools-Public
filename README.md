# The ProSeed Seed Selector
## For finding the seeds that suit your needs!

Welcome to the public repository of the ProSeed Seed Selector. The source code remains private as the logics operating in the background are based on expert knowledge, which is considered to be intellectual property of "De Bolster b.v.". The application allows the user to optimize the seed selection for creating hybrid pumpkin seeds. The application uses knowledge provided by organic seeds breeder "De Bolster b.v.", to determine the phenotype of the child plant after breeding with two parents plants. The current version is a demo version based on mock data, but has been validated by an expert breeder. The program could therefore be used as a useful tool for any pumpkin breeder once real data is fed into the application.
